Ship designs for Kerbal Space Program

Ship and subassembly designs I have built in various versions of
[Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)

Directories are sorted by version number and each contains SPH, VAB,
and Subassembly directories. They are a mix of ships from all my
different saves in that version.
